QEMU is an emulator for many different CPUs.

This patched version adds support for MIPS32 AR7 system emulation.
It can be used for software development of AR7 based routers.

Some extensions (improved flash memory support) are not AR7 specific.

Other extensions (new ethernet cards, eeprom memory support) are
not AR7 related at all.
