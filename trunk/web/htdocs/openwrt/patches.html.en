<h2>OpenWrt Patches for Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE and other routers with BRN bootloader</h2>

<h3>Patch Overview</h3>

<pre>
package/busybox/patches/400-cmdedit.patch
	This patch saves some bytes of code and fixes tab completion
	for the shell (..&lt;tab%gt; works now like in bash).

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/gdb_hook.c
	New file, needed for kernel debugging (kgdb) which is still not working.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/init.c
	Command line and ADAM2 emulation.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/irq-vlynq.c
linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/Makefile
linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/setup.c
	New file and patch for vlynq interrupt 80 (needed for TI WLAN).

linux-2.4.32/drivers/char/avalanche_vlynq/vlynq_hal.c
	Count vlynq interrupts (needed for display in /proc/interrupts).

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/irq.c
	Additional code for vlynq.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/ar7/misc.c
	Changed avalanche_reset_ctrl for vlynq.

linux-2.4.32/net/core/wireless.c
	Improved SIOCGIWPRIV ioctl (still not working).

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/config-shared.in
	Added code for Sinus 154.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/kernel/head.S
	Added jump instruction at address 0x94000000.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/kernel/setup.c
	Check kernel parameters (argc) for valid values.

linux-2.4.32/arch/mips/Makefile
	Changed LOADADDR to 0x94000000 for Sinus 154.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/atm/Makefile
linux-2.4.32/drivers/atm/sangam_atm/Makefile
	Cleaned, moved parts to subdirectory sangam_atm. Needs fix for different annex!!!

linux-2.4.32/drivers/atm/sangam_atm/tn7dsl.c
	Add more information to debug message.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/char/avalanche_led/gpio.c
	Cleaned code and formatting, create missing directory in /proc.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/char/avalanche_led/led.h
	New file with external declarations.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/char/avalanche_led/leds.c
	Added code for LED calls in cpmac and wifi drivers.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/mtd/maps/Config.in
	Sinus 154 only has 2 MiB flash (should be replaced by autoconfiguration).

linux-2.4.32/drivers/mtd/maps/sinus154-flash.c
	Flash map for Sinus 154.

linux-2.4.32/drivers/net/wireless/Config.in
	Wireless not only works with PCI and USB, but also with VLYNQ.

<h3>New Files</h3>

Get the <a href="files.tar.bz2">Tar archive</a> with all new files if
you still use the CVS based OpenWrt.

For the latest OpenWrt, all these files are included in
<a href="svndiff.patch">svndiff.patch</a>.

<h4>target/linux/image/ar7/src/entry.c</h4>

I need a loader with a known start address and had trouble, because the
compiler rearranged the startup code. So this file only defines the very
first startup function.

<h4>target/linux/image/ar7/src/loader.h</h4>

Every external function should be declared in a header file
(and not in C code), so I started a new one...

<h4>target/linux/image/ar7/src/uart16550.c</h4>

I do not know the entry point of the bootloader's output function,
so this code directly uses the serial port for diagnostics output.
It should work with any AR7 based device.

<h4>target/linux/image/ar7/src/uart16550.h</h4>

This file belongs to uart16550.c.

<h3>Old Patches</h3>

These patches were used for the CVS head of OpenWrt.
In November 2005 OpenWrt switched from CVS to Subversion.
The current Subversion version needs different patches.

<h4><a href="007-cpmac_driver.patch">target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/ar7/007-cpmac_driver.patch</a></h4>

This patch contains some minor bug fixes (usable for all AR7 devices)
and additional debug messages (I had trouble getting ethernet running at first,
and unloading of the module still hangs a long time).

<h4><a href="008-sinus154_support.patch">target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/ar7/008-sinus154_support.patch</a></h4>

These patches mainly implement some sort of ADAM2 emulation.
Sinus 154 does not use an ADAM2 bootloader, but the OpenWrt uses many of its
features.<p>

I also had trouble with the original code for trap handling.

<h4><a href="009-diag_driver.patch">target/linux/linux-2.4/patches/ar7/009-diag_driver.patch</a></h4>

OpenWrt CVS head fails during compilation for AR7 because diag.o is missing.
This patch implements two diag LEDs for the Sinus 154 (maybe also for other
devices?).

<h3>New Patches</h3>

OpenWrt switched from CVS to Subversion configuration management.
The <a href="svndiff.patch">latest patches</a> add Sinus support
to OpenWrt trunk (this is the Subversion name for the latest version).<p>

Just get OpenWrt trunk and apply the patch file. It will add new files
and change existing (well, this is what patches are supposed to do),
fix a number of minor bugs, add missing features and add Sinus support...

<h3>Configuration Files</h3>

For the latest OpenWrt, all configuration files are included in
<a href="svndiff.patch">svndiff.patch</a>.

<h4><a href=".config">.config</a></h4>

This is a stripped configuration. The original one from OpenWrt includes
too many features for our 2 MiB flash memory (and needs too much time for
compilation during development).<p>

Some features were added because I needed them during development:
changes for busybox (added cmp, od, rx).<p>

The IP address was changed to the default for Sinus 154, 192.168.2.1.
