<h1>Firmware for Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE and Sinus 154 DSL Basic 3</h1>

The project's goal is to develop an open source firmware for
the router device Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE (and the Sinus 154 DSL Basic 3,
which is nearly identical).
As these devices are only distributed in Germany by Deutsche Telekom,
most documentation is written in german language.<p>

The english translation is an extract of the german text.<p>

The Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE is based on a CPU which is a member of the
AR7 family made by Texas Instruments.
It's original firmware is closed source - maybe
based on the realtime OS VxWorks from WindRiver Systems.<p>

Extensions and bug fixes from Telekom are rare,
so we are looking for a firmware
which must be freely available and
which allows users to make full usage of their hardware.<p>

Of course all experiences made in this project can also be used for
other similar devices. If you are owner of such a device, you are welcome
to contribute.<p>

Please have a look at the developer and user forum and additional
information at the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/ar7-firmware/">
project's web site</a> on BerliOS.

<h1>Important Hints</h1>

Any change of the original firmware is at your own risk.
In the worst case, wrong usage or bad firmware will make your
device unusable.<p>

Especially changes of the bootloader (in flash memory) are fatal
and must be avoided!

<h1>Project Status(2005-09-16)</h1>

Currently, on power on a Linux kernel boots from flash memory and uses the
filesystem (squashfs) from flash. Serial console is available very fast.
Telnet login on IP address 192.168.2.1 is possible 35 s after power on.<p>

See <a href="openwrt/index.html.en">OpenWrt port</a> for details.

<h1>Hardware</h1>

<h2>Devices</h2>

<table summary="devices">
<tr><th>Device</th><th>CPU</th><th>Flash</th><th>RAM</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sinus 154 DSL SE</td><td>Texas Instruments TNETD7300 (Sangam)</td><td>2 MiB</td><td>16 MiB (?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE</td><td>Texas Instruments TNETD7300 (Sangam)</td><td>2 MiB</td><td>16 MiB</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sinus 154 DSL Basic 3</td><td>Texas Instruments TNETD7300 (Sangam)</td><td>2 MiB</td><td>16 MiB</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

There are several other devices with very similar hardware,
for example from AVM (see <a href="http://www.wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/">
Wiki web page</a>).

<h1>Firmware Components</h1>

<h2>Bootloader</h2>

<p>All devices use a bootloader made by Broad Net Technology, INC.
The bootloader allows operation via serial port.</p>

<h3>Debug Menu</h3>

By pressing any key immediately after power on,
the normal boot sequence will stop and the bootloader enters a debug menu.
Pressing a second key <!> enters the administrator debug menu with
additional commands.<p>

<pre>
[U] Upload to Flash
[E] Erase Flash
[G] Run Runtime Code
[M] Upload to Memory
[R] Read from Memory
[W] Write to Memory
[T] Memory Test
[Y] Go to Memory
[A] Set MAC Address
[#] Set Serial Number
[V] Set Board Version
[H] Set Options
[P] Print Boot Params
</pre>

Administrator mode allows firmware uploads, program uploads to memory and
running programs from memory.

<h3>Emergency Kernel</h3>

The bootloader also contains an emergency kernel. Use this kernel to repair
a damaged firmware (this will be possible as long as you do not destroy the
bootloader itself).
The emergency kernel is activated by pressing the reset button at power up
until the operation LED starts to blink.<p>

The kernel starts a DHCP server and a web server. Using URL
http://192.168.2.1/, new firmware can be loaded into the flash memory.

<h2>File Format for Firmware Images</h2>

Use the program <a href="tools/mkfirm.c">mkfirm</a> to create
firmware images. See the source code for more information on the
file format.<p>

Attention! Linux kernel and filesystem are larger than the original firmware.
Both will fit into a single firmware image,
but the bootloader crashs when you try to load this image.
The current version of mkfirm.c supports separate firmware images for
kernel and filesystem which load without any problem.<p>
