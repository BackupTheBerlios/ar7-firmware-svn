<h2>OpenWrt Port to Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE</h2>

<p>The new firmware for Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE is based on the
<a href="http://openwrt.org/AR7Port">AR7 port of OpenWrt</a>.</p>

<h2>Important Hints</h2>

Any change of the original firmware is at your own risk.
In the worst case, wrong usage or bad firmware will make your
device unusable.<p>

Especially changes of the bootloader (in flash memory) are fatal
and must be avoided!

<h2>Projekt Status (2005-09-16)</h2>

<h3>Open Topics</h3>

The most important topics are on top:

<ul>
<li>The flash filesystem JFFS2 still does not work (it was working in an
earlier version made in July).
Obviously, this is caused by the flash size (128 KiB) and the erase block
size (64 KiB). So there are only 2 blocks available, but JFFS2 needs at
last 5 blocks!
<li><a href="tiwlan.html">WLAN</a> does not work.</li>
<li>ADSL might work, but is still untested.</li>
<li>Flash usage is not optized (kernel and filesystem waste 128 KiB each).</li>
<li>Kernel debugger (kgdb) is missing.</li>
<li>Serial port shows wrong baud value:
<pre>
serinfo:1.0 driver:5.05c revision:2001-07-08
0: uart:16550A port:A8610E00 irq:15 baud:6776 tx:1463 rx:44 RTS|CTS|DTR
1: uart:16550A port:A8610F00 irq:16 baud:566 tx:47 rx:0 RTS|DTR
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Working Topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>Firmware (Linux kernel) and user filesystem (Squashfs) can be flashed.</li>
<li>Booting Linux from flash memory works.</li>
<li>Serial connection works and permits control, debug output,
uploads using XModem protocol.</li>
<li>Two diagnostics LEDs work (diag driver).</li>
<li>Ethernet is working, and so are telnet and web servers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operating System</h3>

We use Linux kernel 2.4.30 and other distribution components from
<a href="http://www.openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a>.<p>

You will need Subversion (SVN) head with the
<a href="http://openwrt.org/AR7Port">AR7 port</a>.
Because OpenWrt does not support the bootloader used in Sinus 154,
additional patches and files are needed.
See <a href="patches.html.en">patches.html</a> for details.<p>

During development a loader with compressed kernel is loaded by
serial connection and XModem protocol on RAM address 0x94200000
and started there.
The loader decompresses the kernel to address 0x94000000 and starts it.<p>

You can also load an uncompressed kernel to address 0x94000000
and start it there.<p>

For normal operations, the kernel is a zipped file stored in flash.
The bootloader unzips it to address 0x94000000 and starts it.<p>

A kernel without a filesystem will ony display some boot messages, so we
also need a filesystem (squashfs) in flash memory.<p>

With kernel and filesystem in flash memory, the router needs about 35 s
to be fully operational and to allow telnet connections after power on.
